-Everything in Python is object
-Every object contains set of methods


objects
--------

number
-------
number can be integer or decimal or octal or hexa

aval = 10
bval = 4.5

string
-------
string is defined in single or double or triple quotes

aname = 'python'
bname = "python programming"
cname = """unix shell scripting"""


list ( array in C )
----
list contains set of elements.
Elements can be set of numbers or strings or any combination.
list elements are defined in [].

alist = [10,20,30]
blist = ["python","kafka","ruby"]
clist = [10,20,5.65,"java"]


tuple ( READONLY, IMMUTABLE , UNCHANGABLE)
-----------------------
tuple contains set of elements.
Elements can be set of numbers or strings or any combination.
tuple  elements are defined in ().
****** Elements inside tuple cannot be modified ******


atup = (45,67,34)
btup = ("java","oracle","mysql")
ctup = (56,7.89,"python")



dictionary/hash/map
-------------
dictionary contains elements in key-value pairs
dictionary elements are defined in {}.
** In dictionary, keys are ALWAYS UNIQUE
** In dictionary , key can be number or string
                  value can be number,string,list,tuple,dictionary


syntax :   object = { key:value , key:value , key:value }
example:     book = {"chap1":10 ,"chap2":20 ,"chap3":30 }
           numbers = {1:2,4:5,6:7}
             info = {"chap1":['John',50,"UK"] ,"chap2":['Rita',60,"US"] }



set
-----
set is UNORDERED COLLECTION Of UNIQUE elements of SAME TYPE.
set elements are defined in {}.
** Indexing is NOT allowed in set operations ****


aset =  {10,10,10,20,30}




















Object classification
------------------------


mutable
----------
list
dictionary
set


immutable
------------
number
string
tuple


methods & functions
---------------------

methods: methods are object specific.
         Every object has its own different methods
         All the methods are accessed with . operator

function: functions are common for all the objects.


functions are of two types

- builtin functions
- user defined functions

to display all builtin functions :

In the console :     dir(__builtins__)

builtin functions  
-----------------
print() :
len()   : length of the object
dir()   : will display the dir of all the methods
help()  : just like man
range() :
input()
max()
min()
sum()
isinstance()
id()
zip()


conversion functions
----------------------
int()
float()
oct()
str()
list()
tuple()
dict()
set()
